1. What is the general relationship between voltage and RPMs in a DC motor?
   The general relationship is when the voltage is increased, the RPM is also increased.

2. Would you describe this relationship as linear? Explain.
   Yes. It has some very minor dips here and there, but other than those, the lines on the graph are linear. The data agrees with this, as you can see consistant 
   increments as voltage continues to become higher.

3. What statement would you use to accurately describe the relationship between these two variables?
   When a DC motor is hooked up to a power source (in this case a power supply), the RPM value goes up when more voltage is applied.
